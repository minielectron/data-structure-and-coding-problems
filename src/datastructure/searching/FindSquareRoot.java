* Compute The Integer Square Root
Given an integer n, compute the square root of n, rounded down to the nearest integer.

Example #1:
Input: 25
Output: 5
Explanation: The square root of 25 is 5.*/

/*Solution:
*
* Rephrasing the stated problem, we wish to find the largest integer x such that xÂ²
* is less than or equal to n. In order to find x, we can apply a binary search to the
* interval [0, n], where n is the provided integer. We can eliminate the right half of the
* interval being considered if the square of the number we are currently looking at is
* greater than n. Conversely, we can update our answer variable and eliminate the left
* half of our interval if the square of the number we are currently
* looking at is less than or equal to n. The runtime of this solution is O(log(n)).*/
