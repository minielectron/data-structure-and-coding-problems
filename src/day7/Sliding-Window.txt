We are learning a new technique known as sliding window technique, this technique is useful for
linear data structure problems such as array base, list based, stack, queue etc.

There are two types of this technique:

1.Fixed window length k: the length of the window is fixed and it asks you to find something in
the window such as the maximum sum of all windows, the maximum or median number of each window.
Usually we need kind of variables to maintain the state of the window, some are as simple as a
integer or it could be as complicated as some advanced data structure such as list, queue or deque.

2.Two pointers + criteria: the window size is not fixed, usually it asks you to find the subarray
that meets the criteria, for example, given an array of integers, find the number of subarrays
whose sum is equal to a target value.
