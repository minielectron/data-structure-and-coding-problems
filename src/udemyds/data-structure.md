# Array
- RAM - random access memory based
- Main advantage is we have index of items
- memory address = `array base address` + `index` * `data_size`
- There are n dimension arrays possible
- The main problem with arrays is that we have to know the numbers in advance
- Size is fixed

# Linked lists
- Easy data structure to implement
- item are not in contigous memory, no random accessing
- First item operation is O(1)
- Arbitrary item operations is O(N)


## Application of Linked list
- Low level memory management
  - Heap memory are represented as doubly linked list.
- Application in windows
  - Photoviewer doubly linked list-
- Blockchains

# Stack application [LIFO]
- Browser navigation
- Stack manager in programs memory
- undo redo application
